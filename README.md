Build the image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

Replace `<image-name>` with the name you want to give to your image. For example, `docker build -t my-image .` will create an image named `my-image`.
The dot at the end of the command is important. It tells Docker to look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.
If it was in a different directory, you would replace the dot with the path to the directory containing the Dockerfile, like this: `docker build -t my-image /path/to/Dockerfile`.
